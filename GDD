Basic Concept:
A game where you tend to a hydroponics lab on a space station, watering/fertilising plants as needed, 
	plants changing visually to indicate their needs, and any plant that reaches maturity will increase your score,
		final score will be determined by how many plants have made it to maturity

Elevator Pitch:
Take care of the hydroponics lab of your employers space station, utilising the available tools, plant, tend, care for and harvest
	food to ensure your quota is met!

Art Style:
Cutesy/Chibi pixel art

Overview of features required:
A title screen
Controls/how to play help screen
Player Character that moves around and can pick up/drop things
Tools that the player can pick up, drop and use on plants
Planters that can contain growing crops that periodically require water or fertiliser

Gameplay loop example:
Player spawns in a room full of planting boxes, player walks over to seed box, picks up a seed, places it in the planter.
As the plant grows it needs both water and fertiliser, it changes visual appearance to show which it needs, upon fully growing it plays
	a sound and the player can now use a harvesting tool on them, once harvested a +1 will float up out of them and the score will increase
A two(or more?) minute timer will have players attempting to achieve a high score

Immediate To-do:
*Set up github
*Finish up design documentation
*Create the structures for the plants
*Create the structures for item pickups
*Countdown timer
Score being tracked and increased
Have an item that can be picked up and dropped
*Have a plant that draws into the room and grows to full
